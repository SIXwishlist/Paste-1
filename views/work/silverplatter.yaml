  <p>Silver Platter is the best source to find live music in Phoenix. It started as a simple mailing list full of shows and quickly became "Your Weekly Dish of Desert Culture."  I designed the original site and built a custom event system which utilizes a database of artists and venues to fill out the calendar.</p>
  
  <p class="subtitle">Note: The current site is no longer under my control, and while it retains some interface elements, should not be considered my work.</p>
