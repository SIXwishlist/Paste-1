<h1>Tropical Salvage</h1>
<h2>CSS/PHP/SQL Development</h2>
<p>Tropical Salvage creates furniture with hardwoods salvaged from the islands of Indonesia. I collaborated with Contact Design to build a clean web presence that highlights their eco-friendly business model and eccentric product catalog. The entire site and product catalog are managed through a custom CMS.</p>
