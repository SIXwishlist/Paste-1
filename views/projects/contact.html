<h1>Contact Design</h1>
<h2>CSS/PHP/SQL Development</h2>
<p>Contact is a small design firm made up of good people who do great work. I've shared an office and worked closely with Contact since 2006. (That's me in the pic!) When combining forces on web projects they handle the design while I manage the development.</p>

<p>After moving to a great new office in downtown Salt Lake City, Contact decided to revive their aging website with a clean new design. I built the site with a backend that enables them to keep it fresh with recent creative.</p>
